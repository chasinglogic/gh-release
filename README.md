# gh-release

A simple tool for managing software releases on GitHub.

This is a polyglot tool, so it aims to supports all kinds of Version metadata files for
all languages. I've added the ones that I use every day but feel free to send a PR with
the version file for your favourite programming language.

## Usage

```

                            git remotes if not given

                            title, otherwise title is omitted for Github style
